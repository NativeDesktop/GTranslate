## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/sitemapxml/GTranslate-desktop.git
npm install
nativefier https://translate.google.com --inject ./custom.css
```
After that you will have two new folders created:

- `node_modules`, and
- `Google Translate-win32-x64`

When you open `Google Translate-win32-x64`, you will find `Google Translate.exe` inside. You should be able to run it directly by double-clicking it.

Enjoy :smile:
